## Project Overview

## Background
In today’s modern life, people are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of appearance. Many are willing to spend a considerable amount of money on beauty treatments to enhance how they look. Human needs and desires are endless, always seeking something new (Parinduri & Rahmat, 2022). This opens up a significant opportunity for businesses. As globalization grows, business competition becomes more intense, especially in marketing products and services to consumers. Companies continuously compete to offer attractive solutions that meet consumer needs and wants (Virda et al., 2023).

Perfume has become an essential part of fashion. It is used to complete one’s appearance and boost confidence. Perfume plays a major role in the global market, as it is widely used by people around the world. According to wolipop.detik.com, everything can now be found online, and beauty products like makeup are among the most purchased. Even though physical stores have reopened, many women prefer to buy lipstick or powder through e-commerce—not just because of free shipping, but also due to discounts offered on those platforms.

Interest in perfumes is also growing rapidly in Indonesia. According to Central Insight, the perfume market in Indonesia reached IDR 5.8 trillion in 2022. This growth is driven by the rising middle class who are becoming more fashion-conscious. The increasing number of local perfume brands also supports consumers in investing in quality fragrances to boost their confidence.

Indonesian consumers are highly dynamic. They are open to trying new products as long as they are high-quality and affordable. However, most buyers rely on reviews before making a purchase. This shows they trust the experiences of other users more than brand claims. Therefore, customer reviews play a crucial role in influencing buying decisions.

Today, more local perfume products are emerging, each with unique characteristics and scent profiles. Ideally, consumers would test the scent in person to assess its quality. However, this isn’t possible with online shopping due to physical and resource limitations. As a result, there is a growing need for systems based on machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help understand consumer preferences through product descriptions and customer reviews.

### Problem Statement 

- Create machine learning models that enhance customer discovery experience to predict product with certain characteristic.
- Assist users in selecting a perfume based on keywords such as scent profile, longevity, sillage, perfume concentration (EDT, EDP, Parfum), top notes, middle notes, base notes, and suitable occasions
